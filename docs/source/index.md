# Fable-arch samples

Fable-arch is a set of tools for building modern web applications inspired by the [elm architecture](http://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/index.html).
It is implemented around a set of abstractions which makes it possible to implement custom renderers if there is a need.
Fable-arch comes with a HTML Dsl and a renderer built on top of [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) and all 
the samples here are using those two tools.
Hopefully the samples here show you how to get started and gives you some inspiration about how to build your application using Fable-arch.

You can also contribute more examples by sending us a pull
request [for the samples directory](https://github.com/fable-compiler/fable-arch/tree/master/samples)!
